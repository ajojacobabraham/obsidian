## 1. Introduction 
EIS -> any kind of information system which improves the function of an enterprise business process by integration
-> provides single system central to organisation that ensures that info. can be shared across all functional level and management hierarchies 
-> Increase business productivity and reduce service cycles, product development cycles and marketing cycles.
-> Other outcomes are operational efficiency and cost savings

## 2. Enterprise Business Processes
Busniess Process -> an activity or set of activities that will accomplish a specific organisational goal.
-> Designed as per vision and mission of top mgmt.

Business Process Mgmt. -> Achieve 3E's -> Effectiveness, Efficiency and Economy.
-> Systematic approach 

### 2.1 Catagories of Business Processes 
1. Organisational Processes or Primary Processes
	-> Deals with core business and value chain 
	-> deliver value to customer by helping to produce a product or service 
	-> represent essential business activities that accomplish business objectives
	-> e.g. generating revenue (Order to cash cycle), procurement (purchase to pay            cycle)
2. Supporting Processes
	-> back up core processes and functions within an organisation.
	-> e.g. Accounting, Human resource mgmt., workplace safety.
	-> key differenciator - does not provide value to customer directly
3. Management processes
	-> measure monitor and control activites related to business procedures ans systems.
	->e.g. governance, internal communications, strategic planning, budgeting etc.
	

## 3. Automated Business Processes
BPA -> Technology enabled automation of activities and services that accomplish a specific function and can be implemented for many different functions of company activies, including sales, management etc.
-> consists of integrating applications and using software applications throughout the organisation.

### 3.1 Factors affecting success of BPA (CIAT)
-> Confidentiality : ensure date is available to only the persons who have right to see the same
-> Integrity : ensure that no un-authorized amendments can be made in the data.
-> Availability : ensure that data is available when asked for 
-> Timeliness : ensure data is available at the right time.

To ensure that above parameters are met BPA needs to have appropriate internal controls.

### 3.2 Benefits of Automating Business Processes

- Quality and consistency 
- Time savings 
- Reduced Turnaround times 
- Improved operational efficiency 
- Governance and reliablity
- Visibility
- Reduces costs 

### 3.3 Which business processes should be automated (New topic)

- involving high volume of taks or repetitive taks 
- requiring multiple people to execute tasks 
- time sensitive processes 
- processes involving need for compliance and audit trail
- having significant impact on other processes and systems 

### 3.4 Challenges involved in BPA

- Automating redundant processes 
	-> Sometimes automate process without conidering whether they are necessary or create value
	-> Some business processes and taks require high amount of tacit knowlege (that cannot be documented and tranferred from one person to another) and therefore seek employees to use their personal judgement 
- Defining complex processes 
	-> Required detailed understanding of underlying business processes to develop an automated process
- Staff resistance 
	-> Staff see automation as a way of reducing their decision making power
- Implementation costs


### 3.5 BPA Implementation
Steps involved in implementing BPA :
1. Define why we plan to implement BPA 
	- answer to this question will provide justification for implementing BPA
2. Understand the rules/regulations under which it needs to comply with
	- any BPA created has to comply with applicable laws and regulations
3. Document the process we wish to automate
	- current processes which are planned to be automated need to be correctly and completely documented at this step
4. Define the objectives/goals to be achieved by implementing BPA
	- enables the developer and user to understand the reasons for going for BPA. The goal needs to be clear and precise
5. Engage the business process consultant
	- once entity defines the above, it needs to appoint an expert who can implement it for the entity
6. Calculate the RoI for the project
	- answer for this question may help convince magmt. to say yes to the BPA exercise
7. Development of BPA
	- Once the top mgmt. grants their approval, the right business solution has to be procured and implemented covering the necessary BPA
8. Testing the BPA
	- Before making the process live, the solutions need to be fully tested

## 4. Risk and its Management
### 4.1 Introduction
- Risk is any event which may result in significant deviation from a planned objective resulting in unwanted negetive consequence.

### 4.2 Sources of Risk
Broadly, risk has the following characteristics :
- Potential loss that exists as the result of threat/vulnerability process. 
- Uncertainty of loss expressed in terms of probability of such loss.
- The probability/likelihood that a threat agent may mount a specific attack against a particular system.

### 4.3 Types of risk

** A. Business Risks**

- Strategic Risks
- Financial RIsks
- Regulatory (Compliance) Risks
- Operational
