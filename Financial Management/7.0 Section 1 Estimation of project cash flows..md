## 7.5 Estimation of project cash flows
Capital Budgeting only considers incremental CF from investment likely to result due to accecptance of any project.
Life of a project may be determined by taking into consideration following factors:
- Technological obsolescence 
- Physical deterioration 
- A decline in demand for the output of the project 

Considerations while considering CF Calculations 
- Depreciation : non cash item, does not affect CF directly. Consider tax shield or benefit from depn. Since this benefit reduces cash outflow for taxes, it is considered as cash inflow.
- Opportunity cost : foregoing of a benefit due to choosing of an alternative investment option. They are considered for estimation of cash outflows.
- Sunk cost : Sunk cost is an outlay of cash that has already been incurred and cannot be reversed. These costs do not have any impact on decision making and hence should be excluded.
- Working capital : Initial working caital requirement shold be treated as cash outflow and at the end of the project its release should be treated as cash  inflow.
- Allocated overheads : Since expenditures already incurred are alloted to new proposal, they should not be considered as cash flows. If overhead costs shall increase due to accecptance of any proposal then incremental overhead cost shall be treated as outflow
- Additional capital investment : treated as cash outflows.
