### Q4

Bengal trading company with its HO in Kolkata, invoiced goods to its branch at Mumbai, at 20% less than the catalogue price which is cost plus 50%, with instructions .....

Cost 100

Invoice Price 120          20/100 C = 20/120 IP

Catalogue Price 150     50/100 C = 50/150 s

Disc given on debtors = 13365

So Drs * 15% = 13365

Prompt Debtors = 13365/0.15 = 89100

Prompt Drs % = 89100/99000*100 = 90%

Faulty Drs % = 10%

Provision for disc = 11000*15%*90%

                             = 1485

```

e.g O/s Salary 

```jsx
Salary Ac Dr 
	To o/s Salary
```

e.g Foreign managers commission
