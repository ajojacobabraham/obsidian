If both swap and deemed swap are available 

Hidden Cash payment = Loss / Share

Loss / Share = [ ( No of shares surrendered * Value of old company ) - (No of Shares Obtained * Value of new company ) ]  

                     / [ No of Shares Surrendered ]

E.g. A ltd acquired B ltd 

It was agreed to issue 2 equity shares for every Eq shares held

MPS of A : 25

MPS of B : 60

No of shres = 10000 shares

Analysis :

In this question we have SWAP ( 1:2 ) as well as details for computing deemed SWAP 

MPS(A) = 25

MPS(B) = 60

Assume a shareholder having one share in B ltd .

So his wealth = 1 * 60 = $60

When he surrenders this share worth 60 he receives two shares valued at 25 each i.e. 50 

i.e. This deal resulted in an overall olss of Rs. 10 for one share. This amount should be compensated by purchasing company in Cash/Bank     

E.g. 2 : Sandra tookover Aparna - It was agreed to issue 3 shares for every 5 shares held

MPS(Sandra) = 40 / shares 

MPS(Aparna) = 25 / share  

No of shares in Aparna Ltd = 10000 Nos.

Analysis :

In this question we have SWAP ( 3:5 ) as well as details for computing deemed SWAP 

MPS(Sandra) = 40

MPS(Aparna) = 25

Assume a shareholder having 5 shares in B ltd .

So his wealth = 5 * 25 = $125

When he surrenders this share worth 125 he receives 3 shares valued at 40 each i.e. 120 

i.e. This deal resulted in an overall olss of Rs. 1 for 1 share. This amount should be compensated by purchasing company in Cash/Bank
