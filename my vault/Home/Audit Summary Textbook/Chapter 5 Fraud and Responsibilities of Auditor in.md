# Chapter 5 : Fraud and Responsibilities of Auditor in this Regard

![[Chapter 5 Fraud and Responsibilities of Auditor in/Untitled.png]]

## 1. Meaning of Fraud

The Standard on Auditing (SA) 240 “The Auditor’s Responsibilities Relating to Fraud in an Audit of Financial Statements” deﬁnes the term ‘fraud’ as- 

“an intentional act by one or more individuals 

among management, those charged with governance, employees, or third parties, 

involving the use of deception 

to obtain an unjust or illegal advantage”.

The auditor is concerned with fraud that causes a material misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements.

Two types of intentional misstatements are relevant to the auditor–

- misstatements resulting from fraudulent ﬁnancial reporting and
- misstatements resulting from misappropriation of assets.

## 2. Characteristics of Fraud

### 2.1 Fraud is intentional

The distinguishing factor between fraud and error is whether the underlying action that results in the misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements is intentional or unintentional.

### 2.2 Fraud is a broad legal concept

Fraud involves incentive or pressure to commit fraud, a perceived opportunity to do so and some rationalization of the act. For example:

- management is under pressure, from sources outside or inside the entity, to achieve an expected (and perhaps unrealistic) earnings target or ﬁnancial outcome.
- A perceived opportunity to commit fraud may exist when an individual believes internal control can be overridden,
- Individuals may be able to rationalize committing a fraudulent act.

**2.2.1 Fraudulent ﬁnancial reporting involves intentional misstatements including omissions of amounts or disclosures in ﬁnancial statements to deceive ﬁnancial statement users.**

Fraudulent ﬁnancial reporting may be accomplished by the following:

Manipulation of Accounts:

- requiring great tact and intelligence
- This type of fraud is generally committed:

    (a) to avoid incidence of income-tax or other taxes; 

    (b) for declaring a dividend when there are insuﬃcient proﬁts; 

    (c) to withhold declaration of dividend even when there is adequate proﬁt (this is often done to manipulate the value of shares in stock market to make it possible for selected persons to acquire shares at a lower cost); and 

    (d) for receiving higher remuneration where managerial remuneration is payable by reference to proﬁts.

There are numerous ways of committing this type of fraud. Some of the methods are given below:

(i) inﬂating or suppressing purchases and expenses;

(ii) inﬂating or suppressing sales and other items of income, 

(iii) inﬂating or deﬂating the value of closing inventory; 

(iv) failing to adjust outstanding liabilities or prepaid expenses; and 

(v) charging items of capital expenditure to revenue or by capitalizing revenue expenses.

Fraudulent ﬁnancial reporting often involves management override of controls that otherwise may appear to be operating eﬀectively.

**2.2.2 Misappropriation of Assets:**

It involves the theft of an entity’s assets and is often perpetrated by employees in relatively small and immaterial amounts. 

However, it can also involve management who are usually more able to disguise or conceal misappropriations in ways that are diﬃcult to detect. 

Misappropriation of assets can be accomplished in a variety of ways including:

- Embezzling receipts
- Stealing physical assets or intellectual property
- Causing an entity to pay for goods and services not received
- Using an entity’s assets for personal use

Misappropriation of assets is often accompanied by false or misleading records or documents in order to conceal the fact that the assets are missing or have been pledged without proper authorization.

**2.2.2.1 Misappropriation of Goods**

- more diﬃcult to detect
- Various measures :
    - record keeping about the physical quantities
    - periodic checks,
    - there must be rules and procedures for allowing persons inside the area where goods are kept.
    - external security arrangements
- Auditors can detect this by undertaking a thorough and strenuous checking of records followed by physical veriﬁcation process.
- Also, by resorting to intelligent ratio analysis, auditors may be able to form an idea whether such fraud exists.

**2.2.2.2 Defalcation of Cash**

![[Chapter 5 Fraud and Responsibilities of Auditor in/Untitled 4.png]]

1. By inﬂating cash payments:
2. By suppressing cash receipts:
    - Teeming and Lading
3. By casting wrong totals in the cash book.

## 3. DETECTION OF FRAUD AND ERROR – DUTY OF AN AUDITOR

As per SA 240 “The Auditor’s Responsibilities Relating to Fraud in an Audit of Financial Statements”, 

the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both 

those charged with governance of the entity and management.

General principles laid down in the SA may be noted as under:

1. Auditor is responsible for obtaining reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error
    - SA 200, “Overall Objectives of the Independent Auditor and the Conduct of an Audit in Accordance with Standards on Auditing,” owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that some material misstatements of the ﬁnancial statements will not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with the SAs.
2. Risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error. 
    - This is because fraud may involve sophisticated and carefully organized schemes designed to conceal it, such as forgery, deliberate failure to record transactions, or intentional misrepresentations being made to the auditor.
    - Collusion may cause the auditor to believe that audit evidence is persuasive when it is, in fact, false
    - While the auditor may be able to identify potential opportunities for fraud to be perpetrated, it is diﬃcult for the auditor to determine whether misstatements in judgment areas such as accounting estimates are caused by fraud or error.
3. The risk of the auditor not detecting a material misstatement resulting from management fraud is greater than for employee fraud, 
    - because management is frequently in a position to directly or indirectly manipulate accounting records, present fraudulent ﬁnancial information or override control procedures designed to prevent similar frauds by other employees.
4. When obtaining reasonable assurance, the auditor is responsible for maintaining an attitude of professional skepticism throughout the audit.
