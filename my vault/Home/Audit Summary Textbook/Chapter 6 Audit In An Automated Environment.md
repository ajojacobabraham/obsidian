# Chapter 6 : Audit In An Automated Environment

## 1. What is an automated environment?

An automated environment basically refers to a business environment 

where the processes, operations, accounting and even decisions 

are carried out by using computer systems – also known as Information Systems (IS)

### 1.1 Key Features of automated environment.

## 2. Relevance of IT in an audit

When a business operates in a more automated environment it is likely that we will see several business functions and activities happening within the systems.

- Computation and Calculations are automatically carried out
- Accounting entries are posted automatically
- Business policies and procedures, including internal controls, are applied automatically
- Reports used in business are produced from systems.
- User access and security are controlled by assigning system roles to users

Companies derive beneﬁt from the use of IT systems as an enabler to support various business operations and activities. 

Auditors need to understand the relevance of these IT systems to an audit of ﬁnancial statements.

Such systems also introduce certain new risks, including IT speciﬁc risks, which need to be considered, assessed and addressed by management.

Auditors are required to understand, assess and respond to such risks that arise from the use of IT systems as far as it relates to audit of F.S.

Given below are some situations in which IT will be relevant to an audit, 

- Increased use of Systems and Application software in Business (for example, use of ERPs)
- Complexity of transactions has increased (multiple systems, network of systems)
- Hi-tech nature of business (Telecom, e-Commerce).
- Volume of transactions are high (Insurance, Banking, Railways ticketing).
- Company Policy (Compliance).
- Regulatory requirements - Companies Act 2013 IFC, IT Act 2008.
- Required by Indian and International Standards - ISO, PCI-DSS, SA 315, SOC, ISAE.
- Increases eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness of audit.

Another area where IT can be relevant to audit is by using data analytics using computer assisted audit techniques (CAATs). By using data analytics, it is possible to improve the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of an audit.

## 3. Risks and controls in an automated environment

### 3.1 Understanding and documenting automated environment

Points that an auditor should consider to obtain an understanding of the company’s automated environment

- Information systems being used
- Their purpose
- Location of IT systems - local vs global.
- Architecture
- Version
- Interfaces within systems
- In-house vs Packaged
- Outsourced activities
- Key persons

Given below are some such risks that should be considered: 

- Inaccurate processing of data, processing inaccurate data, or both.
- Unauthorized access to data.
- Direct data changes (backend changes).
- Excessive access / Privileged access (super users).
- Lack of adequate segregation of duties.
- Unauthorized changes to systems or programs.
- Failure to make necessary changes to systems or programs.
- Loss of data.

### 3.2 Impact of IT related risks i.e. on Substantive Audit , Controls and Reporting

### 3.3 Types of controls in an automated environment

- General IT Controls
- Application Controls
- IT-Dependent Controls

**3.3.1 General IT Controls** 

General IT controls are policies and procedures that relate to many applications and support the eﬀective functioning of application controls

General IT-controls that maintain the integrity of information and security of data commonly include controls over the following: (SA 315)

- Data center and network operations
- Program change
- Access security
- Application system acquisition, development, and maintenance (Business Applications)

These are IT controls generally implemented to mitigate the IT speciﬁc risks and applied commonly across multiple IT systems, applications and business processes. 

Hence, General IT controls are known as “pervasive” controls or “indirect” controls.

1. Data Center and Network Operations

    Objective: To ensure that production systems are processed to meet ﬁnancial reporting objectives.

    Activities:

    - Overall Management of Computer Operations Activities
    - Batch jobs
    - Backups
    - Performance Monitoring
    - Recovery from Failures
    - Service Level Agreements

2. Program Change 

    Objective: To ensure that modiﬁed systems continue to meet ﬁnancial reporting objectives.

    Activities:

    - Change Management Process – deﬁnition, roles & responsibilities
    - Change Requests – record, manage, track
    - Making Changes – analyze, design, develop
    - Test Changes
    - Apply Changes in Production
    - User Training
3. Access Security

    Objective: To ensure that access to programs and data is authenticated and authorized to meet ﬁnancial reporting objectives.

    Activities:

    - Security Organization & Management
    - Security Policies & Procedures
    - Application Security
    - Data Security
    - Operating System Security
    - Network Security
    - Physical Security

4. Application system acquisition, development, and maintenance

    Objective: To ensure that systems are developed, conﬁgured and implemented to meet ﬁnancial reporting objectives.

    Activities:

    - Overall Mgmt. of Development Activities
    - Project Initiation
    - Analysis & Design
    - Construction
    - Testing & Quality Assurance
    - Documentation & Training

**3.3.2 Application Controls**

Include both automated or manual controls that operate at a business process level.

Automated Application controls are embedded into IT applications viz., ERPs and help in ensuring the completeness, accuracy and integrity of data in those systems.

**3.3.3 IT dependent Controls**

IT dependent controls are basically manual controls that make use of some form of data or information or report produced from IT systems and applications

The design and eﬀectiveness of such controls depends on the reliability of source data.

**3.3.4 General IT Controls vs. Application Controls**

These two categories of control over IT systems are interrelated

General IT Controls are needed to support the functioning of application controls, and both are needed to ensure complete and accurate information processing through IT systems.

## 4. Testing Methods

![[Chapter 6 Audit In An Automated Environment/Untitled 2.png]]

Inquiry is the most eﬃcient audit test but it is also gives the least audit evidence. 

Hence, inquiry should always be used in combination with any one of the other audit testing methods. Inquiry alone is not suﬃcient.

Reperformance is most eﬀective as an audit test and gives the best audit evidence. 

However, testing by reperformance could be very time consuming and least eﬃcient most of the time.

When testing in an automated environment, some of the more common methods are as follows:

♦ Obtain an understanding of how an automated transaction is processed by doing a walkthrough of one end-to-end transaction using a combination of inquiry, observation and inspection. 

♦ Observe how a user processes transactions under diﬀerent scenarios.

♦ Inspect the conﬁguration deﬁned in an application.

♦ Inspect the system logs to determine any changes made since last audit testing.

♦ Inspect technical manual / user manual of systems and applications.

♦ Carry out a test check (negative testing) and observe the error message displayed by the application.

Conduct reperformance using raw source data and independently applying formulae, business rules or validations on the source data using CAATs.

Where the general IT controls are not existing or existing but ineﬀective, 

the auditor should assess the impact of IT risks and complexity of the automated environment in which the business operations take place and plan alternative audit procedures in order to rely on the system based information

## 5. Internal Financial Controls as per Regulatory Requirements

The term Internal Financial Controls (IFC) basically refers to the policies and procedures put in place by companies for ensuring: 

♦ reliability of ﬁnancial reporting

♦ eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of operations

♦ compliance with applicable laws and regulations

♦ safeguarding of assets 

♦ prevention and detection of frauds

## 6. Data Analytics for Audit

The combination of processes, tools and techniques that are used to tap vast amounts of electronic data to obtain meaningful information is called data analytics.

Auditors can make use of similar tools and techniques in the audit process and obtain good results. The tools and techniques that auditors use in applying the principles of data analytics are known as Computer Assisted Auditing Techniques or CAATs in short

Data analytics can be used in testing to perform the following:

♦ Check completeness of data and population that is used in either test of controls or substantive audit tests.

♦ Selection of audit samples – random sampling, systematic sampling.

♦ Re-computation of balances – reconstruction of trial balance from transaction data. 

♦ Reperformance of mathematical calculations – depreciation, bank interest calculation. 

♦ Analysis of journal entries as required by SA 240. 

♦ Fraud investigation. 

♦ Evaluating impact of control deﬁciencies.

## 7. Assess and Report Audit Findings

Some points to consider are as follows:

- Are there any weaknesses in IT controls?
- What is the impact of these weaknesses on overall audit?
- Report deﬁciencies to management – Internal Controls Memo or Management Letter.
- Communicate in writing any signiﬁcant deﬁciencies to Those Charged With Governance.
