## 1. SAMPLING: AN AUDIT PROCEDURE

< Irrelevant >

## 2. MEANING OF AUDIT SAMPLING

- According to SA 530 “Audit sampling”,
- ‘audit sampling’ refers to the application of audit procedures to less than 100% of items
- within a population of audit relevance
- such that all sampling units have a chance of selection
- in order to provide the auditor with a reasonable basis
- on which to draw conclusions about the entire population.

### 2.1 Population

Population refers to the entire set of data from which a sample is selected and about which the auditor wishes to draw conclusions.

Sample can be expected to be representative of the population

**2.1.1 Characteristics of a Population** 

1. Appropriateness 

    Population from which the sample is drawn is appropriate for the specific audit objective

2. Completeness

    The population needs to include all relevant items from throughout the entire period.

3. Reliable

    The information upon which the audit sampling is performed is sufficiently complete and accurate.

## 3. APPROACHES TO SAMPLING

![[Chapter 7 Audit Sampling/Untitled 1.png]]

- Statistical sampling is an approach to sampling that has
- the random selection of the sample items;
- and the use of probability theory to evaluate sample results,
- including measurement of sampling risk characteristics.
- A sampling approach that does not have above characteristics is considered non-statistical sampling.

**Sample must be representative**

This means that it must be closely similar to the whole population although not necessarily exactly the same

### 3.1 Statistical Sampling- More Scientiﬁc

Audit testing done through this approach is more scientiﬁc than testing based entirely on the auditor’s own judgment because it involves use of mathematical laws of probability in determining the appropriate sample size in varying circumstances.

### 3.2 Non-Statistical Sampling

Under this approach, the sample size and its composition are determined on the basis of the personal experience and knowledge of the auditor

The non-statistical sampling is criticized on the grounds that it is neither objective nor scientiﬁc.

The factors that should be considered for deciding upon the extent of checking on a sampling plan are following: 
(i) Size of the organization under audit. 
(ii) State of the internal control. 
(iii) Adequacy and reliability of books and records.
(iv) Tolerable error range. 
(v) Degree of the desired conﬁdence.

### 3.3 Appropriateness of Sampling Approaches

The advantages of statistical sampling may be summarized as follows -

1. The amount of testing (sample size) does not increase in proportion to the increase in the size of the area (universe) tested. 
2. The sample selection is more objective and thereby more defensible.
3. The method provides a means of estimating the minimum sample size associated with a speciﬁed risk and precision.
4. It provides a means for deriving a “calculated risk” and corresponding precision (sampling error)
5. It may provide a better description of a large mass of data than a complete examination of all the data, since non-sampling errors such as processing and clerical mistakes are not as large.

The decision whether to use a statistical or non-statistical sampling approach is a matter for the auditor’s judgment; however, sample size is not a valid criterion to distinguish between statistical and non-statistical approaches

## 4. SAMPLE DESIGN, SIZE AND SELECTION OF ITEMS FOR TESTING

When designing an audit sample, the auditor shall consider the purpose of the audit procedures and the characteristics of the population from which the sample will be drawn.

### 4.1 Sample Design

When designing an audit sample, the auditor’s consideration includes the speciﬁc purpose to be achieved and the combination of audit procedures that is likely to best achieve that purpose.

### 4.1.1 Stratiﬁcation and Value-Weighted Selection

**Stratiﬁcation**: Audit eﬃciency may be improved if the auditor stratiﬁes a population by dividing it into discrete sub-populations which have an identifying characteristic. The objective of stratiﬁcation is to reduce the variability of items within each stratum and therefore allow sample size to be reduced without increasing sampling risk.

**Value-Weighted Selection**: When performing tests of details it may be eﬃcient to identify the sampling unit as the individual monetary units that make up the population. Having selected speciﬁc monetary units from within the population, for example, the accounts receivable balance, the auditor may then examine the particular items, for example, individual balances, that contain those monetary units.

### 4.2 Sample Size

The level of sampling risk that the auditor is willing to accept aﬀects the sample size required. 

The lower the risk the auditor is willing to accept, the greater the sample size will need to be.

The sample size can be determined by the application of a statistically-based formula or through the exercise of professional judgment

**4.2.1 Examples of Factors Inﬂuencing Sample Size for Tests of Controls**

1. The more assurance the auditor intends to obtain from the operating eﬀectiveness of controls, the lower the auditor’s assessment of the risk of material misstatement will be, 
and the larger the sample size will need to be.
2. If there is an increase in the tolerable rate of deviation, then sample size will decrease
As lower the tolerable rate of deviation, larger the sample size needs to be.
3. When there is an increase in the expected rate of deviation of the population to be tested then sample size will increase, as higher the expected rate of deviation, larger the sample size needs to be so that the auditor is in a position to make a reasonable estimate of the actual rate of deviation
4. The greater the level of assurance that the auditor desires, the larger the sample size needs to be.
5. In case of large populations, the actual size of the population has little, if any, eﬀect on sample size. 
For small populations however, audit sampling may not be as eﬃcient as alternative means of obtaining suﬃcient appropriate audit evidence.

**4.2.2 Examples of Factors Inﬂuencing Sample Size for Tests of Details**

1. The higher the auditor’s assessment of the risk of material misstatement, the larger the sample size needs to be.
2. If there is an increase in the use of other substantive procedures directed at the same assertion, the size of sample will decrease
3. Greater the level of assurance that the auditor requires that the results of the sample are in fact indicative of the actual amount of misstatement in the population, the larger the sample size needs to be
4. An increase in tolerable misstatement will decrease the sample size 
Lower the tolerable misstatement, the larger the sample size needs to be.
5. Sample size will increase in case of an increase in the amount of misstatement the auditor expects to ﬁnd in the population
6. There will be negligible eﬀect on sample size due to number of sampling units in the population

### 4.3 Selection of Items for Testing

With statistical sampling, sample items are selected in a way that each sampling unit has a known probability of being selected. 

With non-statistical sampling, judgment is used to select sample items. 

Because the purpose of sampling is to provide a reasonable basis for the auditor to draw conclusions , it is important that the auditor selects a representative sample, so that bias is avoided, by choosing sample items which have characteristics typical of the population.

### 4.4 Sample Selection Methods

Some of the important methods of selecting the sample are

**(1) Random Sampling**: Random selection ensures that all items in the population or within each stratum have a known chance of selection. 

It may involve use of random number tables. 

Random sampling includes two very popular methods which are –

(i) Simple Random Sampling

It is considered that random number tables are simple and easy to use and also provide assurance that the bias does not aﬀect the selection. 

This method is considered appropriate provided the population to be sampled consists of reasonably similar units and fall within a reasonable range.

(ii) Stratified Sampling

This method involves dividing the whole population to be tested in a few separate groups called strata and taking a sample from each of them.

Each stratum is treated as if it was a separate population and if proportionate of items are selected from each of these stratum

**(2) Interval Sampling or Systematic Sampling:**

Systematic selection is a selection method in which the number of sampling units in the population is divided by the sample size to give a sampling interval

**(3) Monetary Unit Sampling**

It is a type of value-weighted selection in which sample size, selection and evaluation results in a conclusion in monetary amounts

(4) Haphazard sampling

Haphazard selection, in which the auditor selects the sample without following a structured technique

(5) Block Sampling:

This method involves selection of a block(s) of contiguous items from within the population

### 4.5 Sampling and Non-Sampling Risk

Sampling Risk. The risk that the auditor’s conclusion based on a sample may be diﬀerent from the conclusion if the entire population were subjected to the same audit procedure. 

Sampling risk can lead to two types of erroneous conclusions: 

1. In the case of a test of controls, 
that controls are more eﬀective than they actually are, 
or in the case of a test of details, 
that a material misstatement does not exist when in fact it does. 

The auditor is primarily concerned with this type of erroneous conclusion because it aﬀects audit eﬀectiveness and is more likely to lead to an inappropriate audit opinion.
2. In the case of a test of controls, 
that controls are less eﬀective than they actually are, 
or in the case of a test of details, 
that a material misstatement exists when in fact it does not. 

This type of erroneous conclusion aﬀects audit eﬃciency as it would usually lead to additional work to establish that initial conclusions were incorrect.

Non-Sampling Risk. The risk that the auditor reaches an erroneous conclusion for any reason not related to sampling risk.

Sources of Non Sampling risk are :

Human Mistakes 

Misinterpreting the sample results 

Applying audit procedures not appropriate to the objectives of audit 

Relying on erroneous information example: erroneous conﬁrmation.

## 5. PERFORMING AUDIT PROCEDURES

The auditor shall perform audit procedures, 

appropriate to the purpose, 

on each item selected. 

If the audit procedure is not applicable to the selected item, 

the auditor shall perform the procedure on a replacement item.

If the auditor is unable to apply the designed audit procedures, or suitable alternative procedures, to a selected item, the auditor shall treat that item as a deviation from the prescribed control, in the case of tests of controls, or a misstatement, in the case of tests of details.

## 6. NATURE AND CAUSE OF DEVIATIONS AND MISSTATEMENTS

The auditor shall investigate the nature and causes of any deviations or misstatements identiﬁed, and evaluate their possible eﬀect on the purpose of the audit procedure and on other areas of the audit.

## 7. PROJECTING MISSTATEMENTS

The auditor is required to project misstatements for the population to obtain a broad view of the scale of misstatement 

but this projection may not be suﬃcient to determine an amount to be recorded. 

When a misstatement has been established as an anomaly, it may be excluded when projecting misstatements to the population. 

However, the eﬀect of any such misstatement, if uncorrected, still needs to be considered in addition to the projection of the non-anomalous misstatements. 

For tests of details, the auditor shall project misstatements found in the sample to the population whereas for tests of controls, no explicit projection of deviations is necessary since the sample deviation rate is also the projected deviation rate for the population as a whole.

## 8. EVALUATING RESULTS OF AUDIT SAMPLING

The auditor shall evaluate- 

(a) The results of the sample; and 

(b) Whether the use of audit sampling has provided a reasonable basis for conclusions about the population that has been tested.

For tests of controls, an unexpectedly high sample deviation rate may lead to an increase in the assessed risk of material misstatement,

unless further audit evidence substantiating the initial assessment is obtained. 

For tests of details, an unexpectedly high misstatement amount in a sample may cause the auditor to believe that a class of transactions or account balance is materially misstated,

in the absence of further audit evidence that no material misstatement exists.

In case the auditor concludes that audit sampling has not provided a reasonable basis for conclusions about the population that has been tested, 

the auditor may request management to investigate misstatements that have been identiﬁed and the potential for further misstatements and to make any necessary adjustments; or tailor the nature, timing and extent of those further audit procedures to best achieve the required assurance.
