![[Chapter 8 Analytical Procedures/Untitled 1.png]]

As per the Standard on Auditing (SA) 520 “Analytical Procedures”, 

the term “analytical procedures” means 

evaluations of ﬁnancial information 

through analysis of plausible relationships among both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial data. 

Analytical procedures also encompass such investigation 

as is necessary of identiﬁed ﬂuctuations or

relationships that are inconsistent with other relevant information 

or that diﬀer from expected values by a signiﬁcant amount. 

Thus, analytical procedures include the consideration of comparisons of the entity’s ﬁnancial information with as well as consideration of relationships.

**Examples of Analytical Procedures having consideration of comparisons of the entity’s ﬁnancial information with are:**

- Comparable information for prior periods
- Anticipated results of the entity
- Similar industry information or with other entities of comparable size in the same industry

**Examples of Analytical Procedures having consideration of relationships are:**

- Among elements of ﬁnancial information that would be expected to conform to a predictable pattern.
- Between ﬁnancial information and relevant non-ﬁnancial information, such as payroll costs to number of employees.

## 2. PURPOSE AND TIMING OF ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES

### 2.1 Purpose of Analytical Procedures

Analytical procedures use comparisons and relationships to assess whether account balances or other data appear reasonable.

**Analytical procedures are used for the following purposes:**

1. To obtain relevant and reliable audit evidence when using substantive analytical procedures; and
2. To design and perform analytical procedures near the end of the audit that assist the auditor when forming an overall conclusion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements are consistent with the auditor’s understanding of the entity.

If diﬀerences are found to be material, the auditor would ascertain the reasons thereof and assess whether the accounts have been manipulated to inﬂate or suppress proﬁts.

### 2.2 Timing of Analytical Procedures

Analytical Procedures are required in the planning phase and it is often done during the testing phase. In addition these are also required during the completion phase.

### 2.3 Analytical Procedures in the Planning of an Audit

Analytical procedures assist the auditor in understanding the client's business and in identifying areas of potential risk by indicating aspects of and development in the entity's business of which he was previously unaware.

This helps the auditor in determining Nature Timing and Extent of other audit procedures.

## 3. SUBSTANTIVE ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES

The auditors substantive procedures at the assertion level may be test of details substantive analytical procedures or a combination of both based on the auditors judgement.

### 3.1 Factors to be considered for substantive audit procedures

1. Availability of Data : The availability of reliable and relevant data will facilitate effective procedures.
2. Disaggregation : The degree of disaggregation in the available data can directly affect the degree of its usefulness in detecting misstatements 
3. Account Type : Substantive Analytical Procedures are more useful for certain types of accounts than others.
4. Source 
5. Predictability 
6. Nature of assertion
7. Inherent risk

### 3.2 Techniques available as Substantive AP

1. Trend analysis 
2. Ratio analysis 
3. Reasonableness test
4. Structural modelling

### 3.3 Analytical procedures used as substantive tests

In accordance with SA 330

1. Determine the suitability of particular SAP for assertions taking account of the assessed risk of material misstatement and test of details if any for these assertions
2. Evaluate the reliability of the data
3. Develop an expectation of the recorded amounts or ratios and evaluate whether the expectation is sufficiently precise
4. Determine the amount of any difference of the recorded amounts from the expected values that is acceptable without further investigation.

## 4. SUITABILITY OF PARTICULAR ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES FOR GIVEN ASSERTIONS

Different types of analytical procedures provide different levels of assurance.

The determination of particular analytical procedures is influenced by the nature of the assertion and the auditors assessment of the risk of material misstatement.

Particular substantive analytical procedures may also be suitable when test of details are performed on the same assertion.

## 5. EXTENT OF RELIANCE ON ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES

The reliability of the data is influenced by its source and nature and is dependent on the circumstances under which it is obtained .

1. Source of the information available 
2. Comparability of the information available 
3. Nature and relevance of the information available 
4. Controls over the preparation of the information that are designed to ensure its completeness accuracy and validity

SA 500 establishes requirements and provides guidance in determining the audit procedures to be performed on the information to be used for substantive analytical procedures. 

## 6. RISK OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS

Include 

1. the accuracy with which the expected results of the substantive analytical procedures can be predicted 
2. the degree to which information can be disaggregated 
3. the availability of information both financial and non financial

# 7. INVESTIGATING RESULTS OF ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES

If analytical procedures performed in acc0rdance with SA 520 identify fluctuations, the auditor shall investigate such differences by :

1. Inquiring of management and obtaining appropriate audit evidence that is relevant to managements responses 
2. Performing other audit procedures as is necessary in the circumstances

# 8. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES THAT ASSIST WHEN FORMING AN OVERALL CONCLUSION

The conclusions drawn from the results of the analytical procedures designed and performed in accordance with are intended to corroborate conclusions formed during the audit of individual components or elements of the financial statements. This assist the auditor to draw reasonable conclusions on which to base the auditors opinion.

# 9. CONSIDERATIONS SPECIFIC TO PUBLIC SECTOR ENTITIES

The relationships between the individual financial statement items traditionally considered in the audit of business entities may not always be relevant in the audit of governments or other non-business public sector entities;

However other relationships may be relevant.
