# 7. Audit Sampling

1. Relevant Auditing Standard - SA 530 - "Audit Sampling "
2. Simple meaning of the term "Sampling" 

    The process of selecting a few from a population

3. Definition :

    Audit Sampling refers to 

    Application of Audit Procedures

    To less than 100 % items in the population 

    of Audit Relevance

    Such that all sampling units 

    Have equal chance of selection 

    In order to provide the auditor a reasonable basis 

    To draw conclusion about entire population.

4. Characteristics of the population
    1. Appropriateness - The auditor should determine that the population from which the samples are selected is appropriate to achieve the audit objectives  
    2. Completeness - The population should be complete, that implies that the population should include all relevant items from the entire period.
    3. Reliable - When performing audit sampling the auditor should ensure that the information upon which the sampling is performed is accurate and reliable
5. Approaches to Sampling
    1. Two Approaches
        1. Non Statistical Sampling
        2. Statistical Sampling
    2. Non Statistical Sampling 
        1. Meaning : The sample size and its composition is determined on the basis of personal experience and knowledge of auditor.
        2. Advantage : Simplicity in operation 
        3. Disadvantage : 
            - It is neither objective nor scientific.
            - Risk of personal bias in sample selection process cannot be eliminated
            - Sample is not selected based on mathematically based statistical techniques.
    3. Statistical Sampling
        1. Meaning : Sample is selected based on mathematical laws of Probability. 
        2. Advantage : More scientific approach compared to non statistical sampling.
        3. When Applied : The population consists of large number of similar items.
6. Factors should be considered by an auditor for deciding the extend of adopting the sampling technique.
    1. Size of the organization
    2. The IC factors
    3. Reliability of BOA
    4. Tolerable error range 
    5. The expected degree of confidence on AE 
7. Sample selection methods 
    1. Random Sampling
        1. Ensure that all items in the population have known chance of selection 
        2. Involve use of random number table.
        3. Two methods
            - Simple Random Sampling - Each item in the population have equal chance of selection
            - Stratified Sampling - Population is divided into separate groups called strata and the sample is selected from strata.
    2. Interval Sampling
        1. Sample is selected using constant interval between selection.
        2. First interval has a random start.
        3. Two methods 
            - Block Sampling - Selection of a defined block of consecutive items.
            - Cluster Sampling - Population is separated into separate group called cluster and then the clusters are randomly selected.
    3. Monetary Unit Sampling

        This method involves value weighted selection of sample 

    4. Haphazard Sampling 
        1. The auditor select sample without following a structured technique
        2. Not appropriate while using statistical sampling.
8. Advantages of Statistical Sampling
    1. The sample selection process is more objective.
    2. Provide better description of large volume of data without complete examination of all data.
    3. The sample size does not increase with increase in population.
    4. Helps to estimate minimum sample size associated with specified with specified risk and precision.
9. Sampling risk

    Risk that auditors conclusion based on a sample maybe different from the conclusion when the entire population were subjected to same audit procedures.

10. Non sampling risk
    1. Meaning - Risk that the auditor reaches at an erroneous conclusion for any reason other than sampling risk.  
    2. Example - Human Mistake, Applying inappropriate audit procedures, relying on wrong information.
