### Considerations relating to Advances

1. Classification of NPA is based on the record of recovery, availability of security / NW / guarantee shall not be taken into account for treating as advance as NPA.
2. Asset classification would be borrower wise and not facility wise. All facilities including investment in securities would be termed as NPA
3. Accounts regularized near the balance sheet date should be handled with care, as there is chances of ROMM ( SA 315 )
4. CG guaranteed advances, where the guarantee is not repudiated would be classified as Standard Asset, but income recognition on receipt basis.
5. Advances given against NSC,KVP,IVP,Life Policies need not be treated as NPA, provided adequate margin is available and income recognized on accrual basis.
6. Advances under consortium based on the record of recovery of individual member banks.
7. Agricultural advances affected by natural calamities are not NPA, reschedule/ impairment.
8. Reversal of income - If any advance becomes NPA, the entire interest accrued and credited to income account should be reversed if not realized
9. Erosion in value of security : - If realizable value of security is less than 10% of o/s amounts, it straight away is classified as loss assets
10. An account shall be treated as out of order if outstanding balance remains continuously in excess of
    1. Drawing power or
    2. Sanctioned Limit
    For more than 90 Days
11. Calculation of DP 
    1. DP = [ Current Stock Value + Realizable value of debtors ] * Adjustment Margin
12. Stock audit will be done by banks for all accounts having funds > 5Cr.
13. In carrying out substantive Audit Procedure, Auditor shall examine all large advances.
