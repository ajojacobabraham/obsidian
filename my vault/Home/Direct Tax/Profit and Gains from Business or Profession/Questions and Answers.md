Compute the amount of depreciation allowable under section 32 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 in respect of the assessment year 2019-20. Assume that all the assets were purchased by way of account payee cheque

Cost of Pand M                            =           120C

-) Scientific Research                   =             15

Depreciable value                         =            105C

Dpereciation @ 15%                     =            15.75C

Additional Depreciation

Value = 105-20 = 85C

Dpen @ 20 % = 17C

Depreciation = 4.5 C

Additional Depn = 10.5

Total Depn = 15C

P and M Purchased on 1.11.18 = 25

Deduction 20 * 15 % = 3

Depn = 1.875C

Addl Dpen = 25-5 * 35% /2= 3.5C

Total = 5.375C

Grand Total Depn =20.375C

Total Dedn =  7.5C

Calculation  of depreciation 

wdv of plant and machinery  = 420 000

- New machinery = 70 000

less sale of asset = 50 000

WDV as on BS date = 440 000

Depn @ 15% general rate = 66000

PROFITS UNDER PRESUMPTIVE TAXATION U/S 44AD 

Gross receipts =  1 12 11 500

6% = 6 72 690

[[Q16]]

Loss from HP= 23 000

Gross Total Income = 2 64 000

Comp of depn

Opeing = 12 00 000

Additions < 180 = 2 00 000

more than 180 = 2 00 000

Total

less  2 00 000 : 15 000 depn

More = 14 00 000 : 2 10 000 depn

Total 2 25 000
