### 2.1 Procurement of funds

![[1 Scope and Objectives of Financial Management/Untitled.png]]

Funds procured from different sources have different characteristics in terms of risk, cost and control. 

The cost of funds should be at the minimum level for that a proper balancing of risk and control factors must be carried out.

Another key consideration in choosing the source of new business finance is to strike a
balance between equity and debt to ensure the funding structure suits the business.

Sources of funds :

1. Equity
    - best from the risk point of view for the firm, since there is no question of repayment of equity capital except when the firm is under liquidation.
    - usually the most expensive source of funds
    - the dividend expectations of shareholders are normally higher than prevalent interest rate
    - dividends are an appropriation of profit, not allowed as an expense under the Income Tax Act
    - issue of new shares to public may dilute the control of the existing shareholders.

2. Debentures
    - Comparatively cheaper than the shares because of their tax advantage.
    - The interest the company pays on a debenture is free of tax
    - Interest payment has to be made whether or not the company makes profits.
    - high degree of risk since they have to be repaid as per the terms of agreement
3. Funding from Banks:

4.   International Funding

- Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) are two major routes for raising funds from foreign sources besides ADR’s (American depository receipts) and GDR’s (Global depository receipts).

### 2.2 Effective utilization of funds

Some of the aspects of funds utilization are:-

- Utilization for Fixed Assets:

    Funds are to be invested in the manner so that the company can produce at its optimum level without endangering its financial solvency.

- Utilization for Working Capital:

    The finance manager must also keep in view the need for adequate working capital and ensure that while the firms enjoy an optimum level of working capital they do not keep too much funds blocked in inventories, book debts, cash etc.

## 3. Evolution of Financial Management

1. Traditional phase 

    financial management was considered necessary only during occasional events such as takeovers, mergers, expansion and so on.

2. Transitional phase

    The general problems related to funds analysis, planning and control were given more attention in this phase.

3. Modern phase

    It is important to carry out financial analysis for a company. This analysis helps in decision making.

    During this phase, many theories have been developed regarding efficient markets, capital budgeting, option pricing, valuation models and also in several other important fields in financial management.

## 4. Finance Functions ( Finance Decisions )

![[1 Scope and Objectives of Financial Management/Untitled 2.png]]

**Long term Finance Function Decisions :**

1. Investment decision

    Selection of assets in which funds will be invested by a firm.

    The investment of funds in a project has to be made after careful assessment of the various projects through capital budgeting. 

    A part of long term funds is also to be kept for financing the working capital requirements.

2. Financing decision

    Acquiring the optimum finance

    A proper balance between equity capital and debt.

3. Dividend decision 

    Determination as to how much and how frequently cash can be paid out of the profits

    The dividend decision thus has two elements – the amount to be paid out and the amount to be retained to support the growth of the organization

**Short- term Finance Decisions/Function :**

Working capital Management (WCM): Generally short term decision are reduced to management of current asset and current liability (Working Capital Management)

1. Determination of size of the enterprise and determination of rate of growth.
2. Determining the composition of assets of the enterprise.
3. Determining the mix of enterprise’s financing i.e. consideration of level of debt to equity, etc.

## 7. Objectives of Financial Management

### 7.1 Profit Maximization

It has traditionally been argued that the primary objective of a company is to earn profit; hence the objective of financial management is also profit maximization.

Profit maximization cannot be the sole objective of a company.

If profit is given undue importance, a number of problems can arise. Some of these have been discussed below:

1. The term profit is vague. It does not clarify what exactly it means.
2. Profit maximization has to be attempted with a realization of risks involved.
3. Profit maximization as an objective does not take into account the time pattern of returns.
4. Profit maximization as an objective is too narrow.

### 7.2 Wealth / Value Maximization

![[1 Scope and Objectives of Financial Management/Untitled 4.png]]

Finance manager should emphasis on Cash flow for investment or financing decisions not on Accounting profit.

Emphasis on Cash flow for investment or financing decisions not on Accounting profit. 

The shareholder value maximization model holds that the primary goal of the firm is to maximize its market value and implies that business decisions should seek to increase the net present value of the economic profits of the firm. 

So for measuring and maximizing shareholders wealth finance manager should follow:

- Cash Flow approach not Accounting Profit
- Cost benefit analysis
- Application of time value of money.

The market price serves as a performance index or report card of the firm's progress. It indicates how well management is doing on behalf of stockholders.

## 8. Conflicts in profit versus value maximization principle

[[Profit Max v s Wealth Max]]

## 9. Role of finance executive

His responsibilities include:

- Financial analysis and planning
- Investment decisions
- Financing and capital structure decisions
- Management of financial resources
- Risk management

## 10. Financial Distress and Insolvency

Financial distress is a position where Cash inflows of a firm are inadequate to meet all its current obligations.

If distress continues for a long period of time, firm may have to sell its asset, even many times at a lower price. 

Further when revenue is inadequate to revive the situation, firm will not be able to meet its obligations and become insolvent. 

So, insolvency basically means inability of a firm to repay various debts and is a result of continuous financial distress.

## 11. Relationship of financial management with related disciplines

![[1 Scope and Objectives of Financial Management/Untitled 6.png]]

### 11.1 Financial Management and Accounting

The information contained in Financial statements and reports helps the financial managers in gauging the past performance and future directions of the organization.

**Differences** 

Treatment of Funds

accounting - accrual

financial management - cashflows 

Finance manager is concerned with maintaining solvency of the organization by providing the cash flows necessary to satisfy its obligations and acquiring and financing the assets needed to achieve the goals of the organization. 

Thus, cash flow based returns help financial managers to avoid insolvency and achieve desired financial goals.

Decision – making

The chief focus of an accountant is to collect data and present the data while the financial manager’s primary responsibility relates to financial planning, controlling and decision making. 

Thus, in a way it can be stated that financial management begins where accounting ends.

### 11.2 Financial Management and other related disciplines

Financial management also draws on other related disciplines such as marketing, production and quantitative methods apart from accounting.

## 12. Agency problem and Agency Cost

There is a principal agent relationship between managers and owners, which is known as Agency Problem.

Agency Problem is the chances that managers may place personal goals ahead of the goal of owners. 

Agency Problem leads to Agency Cost. 

Agency cost is the additional cost borne by the shareholders to monitor the manager and control their behavior so as to maximize shareholders wealth. 

Generally, Agency Costs are of four types 

(i) monitoring 

(ii) bonding 

(iii) opportunity 

(iv) structuring

**Addressing the agency problem**

Agency problem between the managers and shareholders can be addressed if the interests of the managers are aligned to the interests of the shareholders.

Following efforts have been made to address these issues:

- Managerial compensation is linked to profit of the company to some extent and also with the long term objectives of the company.
- Employee is also designed to address the issue with the underlying assumption that maximization of the stock price is the objective of the investors.
- Effecting monitoring can be done.
