![[2 Types of Financing/Untitled 1.png]]

![[2 Types of Financing/Untitled 2.png]]

## 3. Long term sources of finance

These sources may be broadly classified into:

- Share capital (both equity and preference) &
- Debt (including debentures, long term borrowings or other debt instruments).

### 3.1 Owners capital or Equity capital

Some of the characteristics of Owners/Equity Share Capital are:-

- It is a source of permanent capital
- Equity shareholders are practically owners of the company as they undertake the highest risk.
- Equity shareholders are entitled to dividends after the income claims of other stakeholders are satisfied.
- The dividend payable to them is an appropriation of profits and not a charge against profits.
- In the event of winding up, ordinary shareholders can exercise their claim on assets after the claims of the other suppliers of capital have been met.
- The cost of ordinary shares is usually the highest
- Ordinary share capital also provides a security to other suppliers of funds.

Advantages

- It is a permanent source of finance.
- Equity capital increases the company’s financial base and thus helps further the borrowing powers of the company
- The company is not obliged legally to pay dividends.
- The company can make further issue of share capital by making a right issue.

Disadvantages 

- The cost of ordinary shares is higher because dividends are not tax deductible and also the floatation costs of such issues are higher.
- Investors find ordinary shares riskier because of uncertain dividend payments and capital gains.
- The issue of new equity shares reduces the earning per share of the existing shareholders until and unless the profits are proportionately increased.
- The issue of new equity shares can also reduce the ownership and control of the existing shareholders.

### 3.2 Preference Share Capital

Some of the characteristics of Preference Share Capital are:-

- Such shares are normally cumulative, i.e., the dividend payable in a year of loss gets carried over to the next year till there are adequate profits to pay the cumulative dividends.
- The rate of dividend on preference shares is normally higher than the rate of interest on debentures, loans etc.
- Most of preference shares these days carry a stipulation of period and the funds have to be repaid at the end of a stipulated period.
- Preference share capital is a hybrid form of financing which imbibes within itself some characteristics of equity capital and some attributes of debt capital.

Advantages

- No dilution in EPS on enlarged capital base
- There is leveraging advantage as it bears a fixed charge
- There is no risk of takeover as the preference shareholders do not have voting rights except in case where dividend arrears exist.
- Preference capital can be redeemed after a specified period.

Disadvantages 

- preference dividend is not tax deductible and so does not provide a tax shield to the company.
- Preference dividends are cumulative in nature.
- Also, if these dividends are not paid, no dividend can be paid to ordinary shareholders

### 3.3 Retained Earnings

Long-term funds may also be provided by accumulating the profits of the company and by ploughing them back into business.

### 3.4 Debentures

Loans can be raised from public by issuing debentures or bonds by public limited companies.

- Normally, debentures are issued on the basis of a debenture trust deed which lists the terms and conditions on which the debentures are floated.
- Debentures are either secured or unsecured.
- May or may not be listed on the stock exchange
- The cost of capital raised through debentures is quite low since the interest payable on debentures can be charged as an expense before tax.
- The period of maturity normally varies from 3 to 10 years and may also increase for projects having high gestation period.

Advantages

- The cost of debentures is much lower than the cost of preference or equity capital as the interest is tax-deductible
- Debenture financing does not result in dilution of control.
- In a period of rising prices, debenture issue is advantageous. The fixed monetary outgo decreases in real terms as the price level increases.

Disadvantages 

- Debenture interest and capital repayment are obligatory payments.
- The protective covenants associated with a debenture issue may be restrictive
- Debenture financing enhances the financial risk associated with the firm.
- Since debentures need to be paid during maturity, a large amount of cash outflow is needed at that time

### 3.5 Bond

Bond is fixed income security created to raise fund. Bonds can be raised through Public Issue and through Private Placement.

**Types of Bond**

(i) Callable bonds and

### 3.6 Loans from Financial Institutions:

Bridge Finance:

Bridge finance refers to loans taken by a company normally from commercial banks for a short period because of pending disbursement of loans sanctioned by financial institutions.

## 4. VENTURE CAPITAL FINANCING

### 4.1 Meaning of Venture Capital Financing

The venture capital financing refers to financing of new high risky venture promoted by qualified entrepreneurs who lack experience and funds to give shape to their ideas.

### 4.2 Characteristics of Venture Capital Financing

- It is basically an equity finance in new companies.
- It can be viewed as a long term investment in growth-oriented small/medium firms
- Apart from providing funds, the investor also provides support in form of sales strategy, business networking and management expertise, enabling the growth of the entrepreneur.

### 4.3 Methods of Venture Capital Financing

1. Equity financing:

    The venture capital finance is generally provided by way of equity share capital.

    The equity contribution of venture capital firm does not exceed 49% of the total equity capital of venture capital undertakings so that the effective control and ownership remains with the entrepreneur.

2. Conditional loan:

    A conditional loan is repayable in the form of a royalty after the venture is able to generate sales. No interest is paid on such loans.

3. Income note:

    It is a hybrid security which combines the features of both conventional loan and conditional loan.

    The entrepreneur has to pay both interest and royalty on sales but at substantially low rates.

4. Participating debenture:

    Such security carries charges in three phases — in the start up phase no interest is charged, next stage a low rate of interest is charged up to a particular level of operation, after that, a high rate of interest is required to be paid.

## 5. DEBT SECURITISATION

Securitization is a process in which illiquid assets are pooled into marketable securities that can be sold to investors.

The process leads to the creation of financial instruments that represent ownership interest in, or are secured by a segregated income producing asset or pool of assets.

## 6. LEASE FINANCING

Leasing is a general contract between the owner and user of the asset over a specified period of time.

The asset is purchased initially by the lessor (leasing company) and thereafter leased to the user (lessee company) which pays a specified rent at periodical intervals.

### 6.1 Types of Lease Contracts:

1. Operating Lease:
    - A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not secure for the lessor the recovery of capital outlay plus a return on the funds invested during the lease term.
    - An operating lease is particularly attractive to companies that continually update or replace equipment and want to use equipment without ownership, but also want to return equipment at lease end and avoid technological obsolescence.
2. Finance Lease:
    - In contrast to an operating lease, a financial lease is longer term in nature and non-cancelable.
    - In general term, a finance lease can be regarded as any leasing arrangement that is to finance the use of equipment for the major parts of its useful life.
    - The lessee has the right to use the equipment while the lessor retains legal title.
    - It is also called capital lease, at it is nothing but a loan in disguise.

### 6.2 Other types of lease

1. Sales and Lease Back
2. Leveraged Lease
3. Sales-aid Lease
4. Close-ended and Open-ended Leases

From the lessee's point of view, leasing has the attraction of eliminating immediate cash outflow, and the lease rentals can be deducted for computing the total income under the Income tax Act. 

As against this, buying has the advantages of depreciation allowance (including additional depreciation) and interest on borrowed capital being tax-deductible. 

Thus, an evaluation of the two alternatives is to be made in order to take a decision.
