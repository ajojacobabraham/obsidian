# Chapter 6 Functional Level Strategies

## **1. Introduction**

Strategy of one functional area cannot be looked at in isolation.

Different functional areas of the business are interwoven together and how a functional strategy is synergized with other functional strategies determines its effectiveness.

Functional strategies play two important roles. 

Firstly, they provide support to the overall business strategy. 

Secondly, they spell out as to how functional managers will work so as to ensure better performance in their respective functional areas.

The reasons why functional strategies are needed can be enumerated as follows:

- Functional strategies lay down clearly what is to be done at the functional level. They provide a sense of direction to the functional staff.
- They are aimed at facilitating the implementation of corporate strategies and the business strategies formulation at the business level.
- They act as basis for controlling activities in the different functional areas of business.
- They help in bringing harmony and coordination as they are formulated to achieve major strategies.
- Similar situations occurring in different functional areas are handled in a consistent manner by the functional managers.

## **2. Marketing Strategy**

Marketing encompasses all the activities related to identifying the needs of customers and taking such actions to satisfy them in return of some consideration.

Some of the Marketing variables that affect the success or failure of strategy implementation are as follows:

- The amount and the extent of advertising.
- The kind of distribution network to be used.
- Whether to be a price leader or a price follower?
- Whether to offer a complete or limited warranty?
- Whether to reward sales people based on straight salary, straight
commission, or on a combination of salary and commission?

### 2.1 Marketing

The marketing process is the process of analyzing market opportunities,
selecting target markets, developing the marketing mix, and managing the
marketing effort.

Marketing plays a role in carrying out these objectives

Delivering Value to Customers: 

Marketing alone cannot produce superior value for the customers. It needs to work in coordination with other departments to accomplish this. Marketing acts as part of the organizational chain of activities.

Connecting with customers:

Companies must be customer centered.

They must win customers from competitors and keep them by delivering greater value. 

Since companies cannot satisfy all customers in a given market, 

they must divide up the total market (market segmentation), 

choose the best segments (marketing target), 

and design strategies for profitably serving chosen segments better than the competitors (market positioning).

### 2.2 Marketing Mix

The marketing mix is the set of controllable marketing variables that the firm blends to produce the response it wants in the target market.

These variables are often referred to as the “4 Ps.” The 4 Ps stand for
product, price, place and promotion

The 4 Ps are from a marketer’s angle. When translated to the perspective of customers, they may be termed as 4 Cs. Product may be referred as customer solution, price as customer cost, place as convenience and promotion as communication.

- Product stands for the combination of “goods-and-service” that the
company offers to the target market. Strategies are needed for managing
existing product over time adding new ones and dropping failed products.
Strategic decisions must also be made regarding branding, packaging and
other product features such as warranties. Products and markets are infinitely dynamic
