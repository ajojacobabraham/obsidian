# U1. the concept of money demand

### Introduction

In simple terms [[money]] refers to assets which are commonly used and accepted as a means of payment or as a medium of exchange or for transferring purchasing power. 

For policy purposes, money may be defined as the set of liquid financial assets, the variation in the stock of which will have impact on aggregate economic activity. 

As a statistical concept, money could include certain liquid liabilities of a particular set of financial intermediaries or other issuers

Anything that would act as a medium of exchange is not necessarily money. For example, a bill of exchange may also be a medium of exchange, but it is not money since it is not generally accepted as a means of payment.

### Functions of [[money]]

1. Money is a convenient medium of exchange or it is an instrument that facilitates easy exchange of goods and services.
By acting as an intermediary, money increases the ease of trade and reduces the inefficiency and transaction costs involved in a barter exchange. ( Money eliminates the need for double coincidence of wants )
2. Money is an explicitly defined unit of value or unit of account. All economic values are measured and recorded in terms of money
A common unit of account facilitates a system of orderly pricing which is crucial for rational economic choices. Goods and services which are otherwise not comparable are made comparable through expressing the worth of each in terms of money.
3. Money serves as a unit or standard of deferred payment i.e money facilitates recording of deferred promises to pay. Money is the unit in terms of which future payments are contracted or stated.
4. Money is a store of value. A store of value is an item that people can use to transfer purchasing power from the preset to the future.
Money also functions as a permanent store of value.
Money is the only asset which has perfect liquidity.

**General characteristics [[money]] should possess**

1. generally acceptable 
2. durable and long lasting
3. effortlessly recognizable
4. difficult to counterfeit
5. relatively scarce
6. portable
7. possessing uniformity
8. divisible into smaller parts without losing value

### The demand for [[money]]

It is demanded for its purchasing power
Demand for money is actually demand for liquidity and demand to store value.

## Theories of demand of money

### Classical approach - Quantity theory of money
Irving Fisher - Yale University - "The purchasing power of money "
Changes in the general level of commodity prices or changes in the value or purchasing power of money are determined first and foremost by changes in quantity of money in circulation.

Fishers aproach aka "Equation of exchange" or "transaction approach"
**MV = PT **
M = the total amount of money in circulation ( on avg ) in an economy;
V = transactions velocity of circulation 
P = avg price level ( P = MV\T)
T = total no of transactions 

Extended equation to include demand deposits (M') and their velocity (V')
** MV + M'V' = PT **

PT represents demand for money


### The neo classical approach - The Cambridge Approach
Alfred Marshall , A.C Pigou, DH Robertson, and John Keynes 
AKA "The cash balance approach"

The cambridge version holds that money increases utility in two ways 
1. enbling the possibility of split up of sale and purchase to two different points of time rather than being simultaneous and 
2. being a hedge against uncertainty

thus demand for money also involves precautionary motive in cambridge approach 
How much money will be demanded depends upon partly on the income and partly on other factors mainly wealth and interest rates

** Md = k PY**
Md is the demand for money
Y real national income 
P avg price of currently produced goods and services 
PY Nominal income 
k proportion of nominal income that the people want to hold as cash

### Keynesian theory of demand of money
AKA Liquidity preferance theory 
According to keynes, people hold money for 3 reasons 
1. Transactionary Motive 
2. Precautionary motive 
3. Speculative motive
